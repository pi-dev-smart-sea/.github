## Project Problem and Solution

### Problem Statement
Passengers on boats face significant challenges in managing their reservations and onboard services efficiently. The current systems in place suffer from several limitations:
- Lack of integration, making it difficult for users to manage different aspects of their journey in one place.
- Insufficient accessibility, which hampers user experience and satisfaction.
- Limited personalization options for reservations.
- Inefficient complaint management processes.
- Absence of a coherent loyalty program.
- Poor alignment with sustainable development goals.
- Lack of AI functionalities for user assistance.

### Proposed Solution
To address these challenges, we propose the development of a comprehensive and integrated reservation software using Java and JavaFX. This solution will offer advanced features aimed at enhancing the overall passenger experience. Key features include:
- **Cabin Reservations and Modifications**: Allowing passengers to easily book and modify their cabin reservations.
- **Ordering Additional Services**: Enabling passengers to order extra services seamlessly.
- **Complaint Management and Loyalty Program**: Providing an efficient system for managing complaints and a coherent loyalty program.
- **Event and Promotion Management**: Facilitating the creation, modification, and management of events and promotions.
- **Billing and Accounting Integration**: Streamlining payment and accounting operations within the system.
- **Chatbot Assistance**: Using AI to assist passengers with their queries and tasks, improving the overall user experience.
